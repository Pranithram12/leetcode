-First check wether the newinterval is overlapping with intervals.
-create a result variable(linkedlist) and create a while loop and check if there is no overlapping and add that point in the result.
-create another while loop and check overlapping and here modify the newinterval with  below code , which nothing but finding min of intervalstart and newintervalstart,and max of intervalend and newintervalend.
            newInterval[0]=Math.min(intervals[i][0],newInterval[0]);
            newInterval[1]=Math.max(intervals[i][1],newInterval[1]);
-now add newInterval into the result after no more overlapping.
-add intervals which are not overlapping.(which are after the newInterval).
-convert linkedlist result into an array and return the array.
