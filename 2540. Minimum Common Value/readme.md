The getCommon method is declared inside the Solution class. It takes two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, as input parameters. Two indices, i and j, are initialized to 0, representing the current position in nums1 and nums2, respectively.

The while loop continues as long as both indices (i and j) are within the bounds of their respective arrays (nums1 and nums2). Inside the loop:

    -If the current elements at indices i and j are equal, a common element is found, and the method returns that element (nums1[i]).
    -If the element in nums1 at index i is less than the element in nums2 at index j, increment i to move to the next element in nums1.
    -If the element in nums1 at index i is greater than the element in nums2 at index j, increment j to move to the next element in nums2.

The loop continues until a common element is found or until one of the arrays is fully traversed.

If the loop completes without finding a common element, the method returns -1 to indicate that there is no common element between the two arrays.

This code takes advantage of the fact that the arrays are sorted to efficiently find a common element by iterating through both arrays simultaneously. The time complexity of this approach is O(min(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
