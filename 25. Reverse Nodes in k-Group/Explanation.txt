Input Validation:
-The method starts with validating the input parameters:
    -If head is null or head.next is null (meaning there is zero or one node in the list), or k is 1 (indicating no grouping is needed), then the method returns head as there's nothing to reverse.

Initialization:
-It creates a dummy node to simplify the logic and avoid handling special cases for the head of the list.
-It sets dummy.next to head, making dummy the initial node before the actual list.
-It initializes prev to dummy and curr to head to start traversing the list.

Calculating Length:
-It calls the getlength method to determine the length of the list. This length is used later to determine the number of groups to reverse.

Group Reversal:
-It enters a loop to reverse groups of size k.
-Inside the loop, another loop runs k-1 times to reverse each group individually (except the first node of each group).
-For each group:
    -It stores curr.next in next to keep track of the next node.
    -It rearranges the pointers to reverse the group:
        -curr.next is set to next.next, skipping the next node in the original order.
        -next.next is set to prev.next, inserting next at the beginning of the reversed group.
        -prev.next is updated to point to next, making next the new starting node of the reversed group.
-After each group is reversed, prev is updated to the end of the reversed group, and curr is moved to the next node to prepare for the next group.

Return:
-Finally, it returns dummy.next, which is the head of the modified list with groups reversed.
