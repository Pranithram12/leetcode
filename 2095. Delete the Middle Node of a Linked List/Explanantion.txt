-Find the mid value of the Given Linked list.While mid value traverse the Prev pointer flowwing the turtle.
   while(here != null && here.next!= null){
            prev=turtle; (here prev pointer should follow the turtle)
            turtle=turtle.next;
            here=here.next.next;
        }

-If the prev not equal to null make prev.next is equal to turtle next ,so that the mid value is removed.Else head is equal to head.next
   if(prev != null){
            prev.next = turtle.next;
        }
    else{
        head=head.next;
    }
