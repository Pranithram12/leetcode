Method Signature:
-public String smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode root): This method takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the lexicographically smallest string representing the path from the root to a leaf node.

Variables:
-private String ans = null;: This variable ans stores the result string, initialized to null.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
-The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree recursively.

DFS Helper Function (dfs):
-private void dfs(TreeNode root, StringBuilder sb): This helper function takes the current node root and a StringBuilder sb to build the path string.
-If the current node is null, the function returns without further processing.
-It appends the character corresponding to the current node's value to the StringBuilder.
-If the current node is a leaf node (both left and right children are null), it reverses the StringBuilder (sb.reverse().toString()) to get the path from the root to the leaf.
    -It checks if ans is null (no previous result) or if the current path is lexicographically smaller than ans. If so, it updates ans with the current path.
-The function then recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node.
-After exploring the left and right subtrees, it removes the last character from the StringBuilder to backtrack (sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1)).

Main Function (smallestFromLeaf):
-The main function initializes a StringBuilder and calls the dfs function with the root node and the empty StringBuilder.
-After the DFS traversal completes, it returns the value of ans, which holds the lexicographically smallest path from the root to a leaf node.
