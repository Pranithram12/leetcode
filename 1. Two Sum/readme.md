1-HashMap Initialization: Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
The code creates a HashMap named m to store integers from the array (nums) and their corresponding indices.

2-Iterating through the Array:
The code uses an infinite loop to iterate through the array. The loop will break when the solution is found and the method returns.

3-Current Element and Complement Calculation:
x represents the current element in the array, and y is the complement needed to make the sum of x and y equal to the target value.

4-Checking for Complement in HashMap:
The code checks if the complement y is already present in the HashMap. If found, it means that the current element (x) and its complement (y) add up to the target value. In this case, the method returns the indices of these two elements.

5-Adding Element to HashMap:
If the complement is not found, the current element and its index are added to the HashMap for future reference.

6-Infinite Loop:
The loop continues indefinitely until a solution is found and the method returns. If no solution is found, the loop will continue indefinitely.
