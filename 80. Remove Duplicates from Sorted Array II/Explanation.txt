Duplication Check:
-The code starts by checking if the array's length is less than 3. If so, it directly returns the length because there cannot be any duplicates to remove in such a short array.
Index Initialization:
-It initializes an index variable to 2. This index will be used to track the position in the array where non-duplicate elements will be stored.
Iterating through the Array:
-Starting from index 2, the code loops through the array. This index is chosen because the first two elements are considered non-duplicates by default.
Identifying Non-Duplicates:
-At each step, it checks if the current element is different from the element two positions behind the current index. If they are not equal, it means the current element is a non-duplicate.
Updating the Array:
-When a non-duplicate is found, it is placed in the array at the position indicated by the index variable. This effectively removes duplicates beyond the first two occurrences because only non-duplicates are stored in the array.
Counting Unique Elements:
-The index variable, which is incremented whenever a non-duplicate is found, effectively represents the count of unique elements in the array after duplicates are removed.
Returning the Result:
-Finally, the method returns this count of unique elements, providing the desired result of the operation.
