-The code defines a class Solution with a method maxDepth that takes a String parameter s.
-It initializes two variables curropen and maxopen to track the current depth of parentheses and the maximum depth encountered so far, respectively.
-It then iterates through each character in the input string s using a for loop.
-Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is an opening parenthesis '('. If it is, it increments the curropen variable to keep track of the depth.
-If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', it decrements the curropen variable as a closing parenthesis indicates the end of a nested level.
-After each character is processed, it updates the maxopen variable using Math.max(maxopen, curropen) to keep track of the maximum depth encountered so far.
-Finally, it returns the maximum depth (maxopen) after processing the entire input string.
