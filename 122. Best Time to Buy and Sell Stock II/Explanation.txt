Initialization:
-int n = prices.length;: Calculates the length of the prices array, representing the number of days or elements in the stock price data.
-int profit = 0;: Initializes the profit variable to track the total profit obtained from buying and selling stocks.
Iterating through Prices:
-The loop starts from index 1 (i=1) to compare each day's price with the previous day's price.
Profit Calculation:
-Checks if the price on the current day is greater than the price on the previous day (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]).
-If true, it calculates the profit by subtracting the previous day's price from the current day's price and adds this profit to the total profit variable (profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]).
Return Profit:
-Finally, the method returns the total profit obtained from all profitable transactions (buying low and selling high) based on the price changes in the prices array.
