The Solution class contains a method reverse that takes an integer x as input. Inside the method, a variable ans of type long is initialized to 0. We use a long type for ans to handle potential overflow during the reverse operation.
The while loop continues as long as x is not equal to 0. Inside the loop:

    -Multiply ans by 10 to shift its digits to the left.
    -Add the last digit of x (obtained using x % 10) to ans.
    -Update x by removing its last digit (achieved by x /= 10).
    -This process continues until all digits of the original number are processed.

Finally, after the loop, the method checks if the reversed number stored in ans is within the range of 32-bit signed integers (i.e., within the range of Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE). If it is outside this range, the method returns 0 to indicate overflow. Otherwise, it casts ans to an int and returns the reversed integer.
