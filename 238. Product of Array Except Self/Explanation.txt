Initializing Arrays: 
-Two arrays, left and right, are initialized with the same length as the input array nums.
-These arrays will store the product of elements to the left and right of each element in nums, respectively.

Calculating Products to the Left:
-The left array is populated by iterating through nums from index 1 to the end.
-At each index i, the value in left[i] is calculated by multiplying the previous value in left[i-1] with the corresponding element in nums[i-1]. 
-The initial value of left[0] is set to 1.

Calculating Products to the Right: 
-Similarly, the right array is populated by iterating through nums from the second-to-last index to the first index. 
-At each index i, the value in right[i] is calculated by multiplying the next value in right[i+1] with the corresponding element in nums[i+1].
-The initial value of right[nums.length-1] is set to 1.

Combining Left and Right Products: 
-After calculating left and right, a new array ans is created to store the final product values.
- For each index i, the value in ans[i] is calculated by multiplying the corresponding values in left[i] and right[i]. 
-This gives the product of all elements except for the one at index i.

Returning the Result:
-Finally, the ans array containing the products of all elements except self is returned as the result.
