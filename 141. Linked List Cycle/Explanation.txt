ListNode Definition:
-Defines a singly-linked list node class ListNode with an integer value (val) and a reference to the next node (next).
-Includes a constructor ListNode(int x) to initialize a node with a given value and set its next reference to null.

Solution Class:
-Contains the hasCycle method to detect if a linked list contains a cycle.
-Takes the head of the linked list as input.

Null Check:
-Checks if the input head is null. If it is, the method returns false as there can't be a cycle in an empty list.

Initialization:
-Initializes two pointers, here and turtle, both pointing to the head of the list initially.

While Loop:
-Checks if here is not null and here.next is not null, ensuring that there are at least two more nodes ahead.
-Moves here two steps forward (here=here.next.next) and turtle one step forward (turtle=turtle.next).

Cycle Detection:
-Checks in each iteration if here has caught up to turtle, which indicates the presence of a cycle.
-If a cycle is detected (here == turtle), the method immediately returns true.

Returning Result:
-If the loop completes without finding a cycle, the method returns false, indicating that the linked list does not contain a cycle.
