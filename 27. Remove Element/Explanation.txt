Initialization:
-count is initialized to 0. This variable will track the number of elements remaining in the array after removing elements equal to val.
-The for loop iterates through each element of the nums array, starting from index 0 and ending at index nums.length - 1.
Check and Remove:
-Within the loop, it checks if the current element nums[i] is not equal to the value val that needs to be removed.
-If nums[i] is not equal to val, it means this element should be kept in the array.
-It then assigns nums[i] to the position indicated by count in the array (nums[count] = nums[i]) and increments count.
    -This effectively shifts non-val elements towards the beginning of the array, overwriting positions where val elements were found.
Return Count:
-After the loop completes, count represents the number of elements in the modified array where val is not present.
-It returns count, which is the length of the array after removing all instances of val.
