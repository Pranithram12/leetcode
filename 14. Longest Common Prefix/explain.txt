Handling Empty Input (Note):
-The code starts by checking if the input array strs is either null or empty (length is 0).
-If so, it returns an empty string (""), which is the correct answer for this case.

Sorting the Input:
-If the input is not empty, the code uses the Arrays.sort method to sort the array of strings (strs).
-Sorting helps in efficiently finding the common prefix. 
-The strings with the least overlap (likely the most dissimilar) will end up at the beginning and end of the sorted list.

Extracting Strings for Comparison: 
-After sorting, it assigns two variables:
   -str1: Holds the first element from the sorted array (strs[0]).
   -str2: Holds the last element from the sorted array (strs[strs.length-1]).

Iterative Character Comparison:
-It initializes a variable index to 0. This variable keeps track of the number of characters that match in the prefix.
-The code enters a while loop that continues as long as index is within the length of str1.
-Inside the loop, it compares the characters at the current index position in both str1 and str2.
-If the characters match, the index is incremented.
-If the characters don't match, the loop breaks.

Returning the Prefix:
-After the loop exits, it extracts the prefix using str1.substring(0, index) and returns it. 
-This substring represents the characters from the beginning of str1 (index 0) up to, but not including, the index (index).
