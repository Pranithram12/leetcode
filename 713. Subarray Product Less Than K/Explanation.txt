Initialization:
-start, end, product, and count are initialized to 0.
-n is set to the length of the array nums, which is 4.
-Since k = 100 is greater than 1, the code proceeds.

Main Loop:
-Begin the loop with end less than n (which is 4 in this case).

Expansion Phase:
-Multiply product by nums[end]. Initially, product = 1 * 10 = 10.
-Increment end to 1.

Expansion Phase (continued):
-Multiply product by nums[end]. Now, product = 10 * 5 = 50.
-Increment end to 2.

Expansion Phase (continued):
-Multiply product by nums[end]. Now, product = 50 * 2 = 100.

Shrinking Phase:
-Since product >= k, enter the shrinking loop.
-Divide product by nums[start] (100 / 10 = 10).
-Increment start to 1.

Counting Subarrays:
-Calculate the count of subarrays meeting the condition (product < k) using (end - start + 1). In this case, count = (2 - 1 + 1) = 2.
-Add this count to the total count variable.

Expansion Phase (continued):
-Multiply product by nums[end]. Now, product = 10 * 2 = 20.
-Increment end to 3.

Counting Subarrays (continued):
-Calculate the count of subarrays (product < k). In this case, count = (3 - 1 + 1) = 3.
-Add this count to the total count variable.

Expansion Phase (continued):
-Multiply product by nums[end]. Now, product = 20 * 6 = 120.

Shrinking Phase (continued):
-Since product >= k, enter the shrinking loop.
-Divide product by nums[start] (120 / 5 = 24).
-Increment start to 2.

Counting Subarrays (continued):
-Calculate the count of subarrays (product < k). In this case, count = (4 - 2 + 1) = 3.
-Add this count to the total count variable.

End of Loop:
-The loop ends as end becomes equal to n.

Return Count:
-Return the total count of subarrays, which is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.

So, the code correctly identifies 8 subarrays in nums = [10, 5, 2, 6] that have a product less than k = 100, as shown in the output and explanation provided earlier
