Initialization:
-totalJumps: Initializes a variable to keep track of the total number of jumps required.
-destination: Sets the destination index to the last index of the nums array.
-coverage: Tracks the maximum reachable index after each jump.
-lastJumpIdx: Indicates the index where the last jump occurred.
-Checks if the length of the nums array is 1. If so, directly returns 0 jumps because there's no need to jump.
-Iterating through the Array:
-The loop iterates through each index of the nums array.
Updating Coverage:
-Calculates the maximum reachable index (coverage) by taking the maximum value between the current coverage and the sum of the current index i and its value nums[i].
Checking for Jump Opportunity:
-Checks if the current index i is equal to the lastJumpIdx, indicating that a jump can be made from the last jump point.
-Updates lastJumpIdx to the new coverage index (coverage).
-Increments totalJumps to count the number of jumps made.
-Checks if the coverage is greater than or equal to the destination index. If so, returns the total number of jumps made (totalJumps), as the destination has been reached.
Returning Total Jumps:
-If the loop completes without reaching the destination, it returns the total number of jumps made (totalJumps).
