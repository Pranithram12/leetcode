Initialization:
-Two pointers fast and slow are initialized to the first element of the array nums.

Phase 1: Cycle Detection:
-The code uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect the intersection point of the cycle within the array.
-In a while loop that runs indefinitely (while (true)), the slow pointer moves one step forward (slow = nums[slow]) and the fast pointer moves two steps forward (fast = nums[nums[fast]]) in each iteration.
-The loop continues until slow and fast meet at the intersection point, which indicates the presence of a cycle in the array.
-When slow and fast are equal, the loop breaks (if (slow == fast) { break; }).

Phase 2: Finding the Entry Point of the Cycle:
-After detecting the intersection point, the slow pointer is reset to the first element of the array (slow = nums[0]).
-Another while loop is used to find the entry point of the cycle, where both slow and fast move one step forward at the same pace (slow = nums[slow] and fast = nums[fast]) until they meet again.
-The meeting point of slow and fast in this phase is the duplicate number in the array.

Return Result:
-The duplicate number (either slow or fast, as they meet at the same position) is returned as the result of the findDuplicate method.
