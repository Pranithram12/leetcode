Finding Maximum Element:
-The code starts by finding the maximum element in the input array nums.
-It initializes maxelement to 0 and iterates through each element in nums to update maxelement with the maximum value encountered.

Sliding Window Approach:
-The code then uses a sliding window approach to count subarrays where the frequency of the maximum element is equal to k.

Initialization:
-Initialize start, end, count, and maxelementfreqcount variables.
-start and end mark the current window's boundaries.
-count keeps track of the total count of subarrays meeting the condition.
-maxelementfreqcount counts the frequency of the maximum element in the current window.

Main Loop:
-The main loop runs until end reaches the end of the array nums.
-In each iteration, it performs two phases: Expansion and Shrinking.

Expansion Phase:
-If the element at index end in nums is equal to maxelement, increment maxelementfreqcount to track its frequency in the current window.

Shrinking Phase:
-While the frequency of maxelement in the current window equals k:
-Add the count of subarrays that can be formed from the remaining elements in the array (count += n - end).
-Move start forward and decrement maxelementfreqcount if the element at start is equal to maxelement.

Update Count:
-After the shrinking phase, update count by adding the count of subarrays that meet the condition.

Move End Pointer:
-Increment end to move to the next element in the array for the next iteration.

Return Count:
-After the loop completes, return the total count of subarrays meeting the condition.
