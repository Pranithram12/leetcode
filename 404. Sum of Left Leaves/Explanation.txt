-The sumOfLeftLeaves method takes a TreeNode called root as input and returns an integer, which represents the sum of values of all the left leaves in the binary tree rooted at root.

-The base case of the recursion is handled first. If root is null, indicating an empty subtree, the method returns 0.

-If root is not null, the variable ans is initialized to 0. This variable will store the sum of left leaves' values.

-The code then checks if the left child of the current node root is not null. If it's not null, further checks are performed to determine if it's a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children). If it is a leaf node, its value is added to ans. Otherwise, the sumOfLeftLeaves method is recursively called on the left child.

-After processing the left child (whether it's a leaf or not), the sumOfLeftLeaves method is recursively called on the right child of the current node root.

-Finally, the value of ans containing the sum of left leaves' values is returned as the result.
