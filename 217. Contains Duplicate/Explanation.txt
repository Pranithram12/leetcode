Sorting the Array:
-The code begins by sorting the input array nums in ascending order using the Arrays.sort(nums) method. 
-Sorting the array is crucial for the subsequent logic.

Checking for Duplicate Elements:
-After sorting the array, the code iterates through the sorted array starting from index 1 (not 0) using a for loop: for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++).
-The loop checks each element of the array against its previous element to identify adjacent duplicate elements.

Finding Duplicates:
-Inside the loop, the code checks if the current element nums[i] is equal to the previous element nums[i - 1]. If they are equal, it means there is a duplicate element in the array.
-When a duplicate element is found, the code immediately returns true, indicating that the array contains at least one duplicate.

Returning Result:
-If the loop completes without finding any adjacent duplicate elements, the code reaches the return false; statement, indicating that there are no duplicates in the array.
-In this case, the method returns false, indicating that the array does not contain any duplicates.
