Input Validation:
-The method starts with validating the input parameters:
    -If n (the number of flowers to place) is 0, it immediately returns true because there are no flowers to place, and the condition is already met.

Main Loop:
-It iterates through the flowerbed array using a for loop.
-For each position i in the flowerbed:
    -Checks if the current position is empty (flowerbed[i] == 0).
    -Checks if the adjacent positions are also empty (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 for the left neighbor and flowerbed[i + 1] == 0 for the right neighbor).
    -If both conditions are true (meaning there's space to place a flower), it places a flower by setting flowerbed[i] = 1.
    -Increments the count variable to keep track of the number of flowers placed.
    -Checks if the required number of flowers (n) has been placed. If so, it returns true because the condition is satisfied.
    
Return Statement:
-If the loop completes without placing the required number of flowers (count != n), the method returns false because the condition couldn't be met.
