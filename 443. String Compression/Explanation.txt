-The compress method takes an array of characters (chars) as input and returns an integer.

-It uses two pointers, idx and i, initialized to 0, to track the current index being processed and the start of the current sequence, respectively.

-The code uses a while loop that continues until i reaches the end of the array.

-Within the loop, it initializes another pointer j to i and advances j until it reaches a different character or the end of the array.

-It then calculates the length of the current sequence (len) by subtracting i from j.

-If the length is greater than 1, it converts the length to a string s and iterates through each character of s, adding it to the chars array at index idx and incrementing idx.

-After processing the current sequence, it updates i to j to move to the next sequence.

-Finally, it returns the updated value of idx, which represents the length of the compressed array.
