String Concatenation Check:
-The gcdOfStrings method starts by concatenating str1 and str2 (str1 + str2) and then concatenating str2 and str1 (str2 + str1).
-It checks if the concatenated strings are equal using the equals method (!(str1 + str2).equals(str2 + str1)).
-If the concatenated strings are not equal, it means that str1 and str2 cannot form a common divisor, so it returns an empty string "".

GCD Calculation for Lengths:
-If the concatenated strings are equal, the code calculates the lengths of str1 and str2 (len1 and len2 respectively).
-It then calls the gcd method with len1 and len2 as arguments to calculate their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

GCD Method (gcd):
-The gcd method is implemented using the Euclidean algorithm.
-It checks if b (the second argument) is zero. If so, it returns a (the first argument) as the GCD.
-If b is not zero, it calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the modulus operator % (a % b).
-It then recursively calls itself with b and a % b as arguments until b becomes zero.

Substring Extraction:
-After obtaining the GCD of the lengths, the code returns a substring of str1 starting from index 0 and ending at the calculated GCD value (exclusive).
-This substring represents the common divisor of str1 and str2.
