-The checkValidString method takes a string s as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is valid in terms of parentheses.

-Two variables, low and high, are initialized to keep track of the lower and upper bounds of the number of valid '(' characters.

-The code iterates through each character in the string using a for-each loop.

-Inside the loop, there's a switch-case statement to handle three types of characters: '(' (opening parenthesis), ')' (closing parenthesis), and '*' (asterisk).

-When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', both low and high are incremented.

-When encountering a closing parenthesis ')', low is decremented if it's greater than 0 (ensuring it doesn't go negative), and high is decremented.

-When encountering an asterisk '', low is decremented if it's greater than 0 (ensuring it doesn't go negative), and high is incremented. This is because '' can act as either '(' or ')'.

-If at any point high becomes negative (meaning there are more closing parentheses than opening parentheses), the method immediately returns false, indicating an invalid string.

-Finally, the method checks if low is zero, which means all opening parentheses have been matched with closing parentheses, and returns true if so, indicating a valid string.
