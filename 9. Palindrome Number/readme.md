1-Negative Number Check:
If the input integer is negative, it cannot be a palindrome, as palindromes are defined for non-negative integers. The method returns false in this case.


2-String Conversion:
The integer is converted to a string (strX) to facilitate character comparison.

3-Two Pointers Approach:
Two pointers, left and right, are initialized at the start and end of the string, respectively.

4-Character Comparison:
The method uses a while loop to compare characters at the left and right pointers.
If the characters do not match, the method immediately returns false, indicating that the integer is not a palindrome.

5-Two Pointers Movement:
If the characters at the pointers match, the pointers are moved towards each other (inward).

6-Palindrome Check Conclusion:
If the loop completes without returning false, the entire string has been checked, and the method returns true, indicating that the original integer is a palindrome.

Note:
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n/2), where n is the number of digits in the integer.
The conversion of the integer to a string is a common approach for palindrome checks, and the two-pointers technique efficiently compares characters from the start and end of the string.
