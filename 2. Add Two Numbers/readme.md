The Solution class contains a method addTwoNumbers that takes two linked lists l1 and l2 as input. It initializes a dummy node with a value of 0, and a curr node that initially points to the dummy node. The variable carry is used to keep track of any carry that needs to be added to the next node.

This while loop continues until both input linked lists (l1 and l2) and any carry are processed. Inside the loop:
    -If l1 is not null, add its value to the carry and move to the next node.
    -If l2 is not null, add its value to the carry and move to the next node.
    -Create a new node with a value equal to the current carry modulo 10 and set it as the next node of curr.
    -Update the carry by dividing it by 10.
    -Move curr to the next node

Finally, the method returns the next node of the dummy node, which represents the head of the resulting linked list after adding the two input linked lists.
