Initialization:
-Initialize the time variable to 0.

While Loop:
-The while loop continues until the person at position k has bought all their tickets (i.e., tickets[k] becomes 0).

For Loop Inside While Loop:
-Within each iteration of the while loop, a for loop iterates through all people in the queue.
-If the person at position k has already bought all their tickets (tickets[k] == 0), the for loop breaks, and the while loop continues.
-Otherwise, if the person at position i still has tickets to buy (tickets[i] != 0), the code decrements the number of tickets the person at position i has (tickets[i] -= 1) and increments the time variable to count the time taken to buy that ticket.

Return Time:
-After the while loop finishes (when tickets[k] becomes 0), the code returns the total time taken (time) for the person at position k to finish buying tickets.
